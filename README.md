# Bash Academy

Learning bash scripting. I have used it to build in line pipelines for SysAdmin work, but want to get muscle memory with larger scripted pipelines. 

## Structure

I have some files including cheat sheets and aliases in the `notes/` directory. 

The `scripts/` directory includes some exercise problem statements with requirements as well as the implementation and any necessary files.
